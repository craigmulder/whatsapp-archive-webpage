<p>1/10/25, 3:00PM - Ninotte Lubin: A third boy for the year</p>
<p></p>
<p>We had a girl last night, cord prolapse, heavy meconium. We managed to have the birth at the center be cause we could.</p>
<p>Birth happened, HPP and newborn resuscitation with transfer of the baby.</p>
<p>In the morning, mom left to breastfeed the baby as she got called then, around noon they called to say baby passed. </p>
<p>We weren‚Äôt too surprised because she swallowed too much liquid. However, we managed to have her transferred with O2 and alive.</p>
<p>1/10/25, 3:01PM - Ninotte Lubin: And, the private hospital she went is not too equipped</p>
<p>1/10/25, 3:02PM - Ninotte Lubin: We are happy to finally have a birth that did not require too much of us.</p>
<p>1/10/25, 3:08PM - Lynette Biery: Glad you had a healing birth. Love and prayers to all.</p>

<p>1/13/25, 10:18PM - Craig Mulder: Jonathan Katz, author of a recent book on Haiti, posted an essay in remembrance of the earthquake. It ends with this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>" But the reality is that, while yes, the problems are still there, the solutions are also still in reach. We just have to remember, once again, that lesson so many of us took on that awful night: Wherever we are, and whatever our station, we‚Äôre all in this together."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The entire essay is here: https://theracket.news/p/15-years-of-solitude-haiti-earthquake-anniversary</p>
<p>1/13/25, 10:32PM - Craig Mulder: To follow up, here's another essay, from The Guardian, that was written on the 10th anniversary of the earthquake. It recounts all the ways that international aid, primarily US, has harmed Haiti.</p>

<p>However, the tire axis needs to be replaced. </p>
<p>I‚Äôll find out tomorrow the cost</p>

<p>4/23/25, 6:36PM - Melinda Parenteau: What?!?!?! ü§Ø</p>
<p>4/23/25, 6:36PM - Melinda Parenteau: Use of action around the center like a bunch of people present, walking around or a clump of babies and moms together. Something that would exemplify how busy it is</p>
<p>4/23/25, 6:36PM - Melinda Parenteau: Sorry I was saying can you get a bunch of pictures like I'm describing above</p>
<p>4/23/25, 6:36PM - Melinda Parenteau: My presentation is coming up</p>

<p>4/25/25, 9:39AM - Lynette Biery: Ninotte, I hope you are getting some rest. Such beautiful babies. The pictures Melinda describes would be great. Also, remember I‚Äôd like a description of a birth from the midwife/nurse‚Äôs perspective, done in a time line, comments from mom/family are welcome too. I need this by 4/30 to have ready for 5/5.</p>

<p>4/25/25, 10:58AM - Craig Mulder: I think these are for sale in Haiti</p>
<p>4/25/25, 11:02AM - Melinda Parenteau: Agreed</p>
<p>4/25/25, 11:26AM - Kate Mazzara: What is the benefit of them being rechargeable as a posed to plug in. Just a ? For understanding.</p>
<p>4/25/25, 11:29AM - Ninotte Lubin: Fits for the solar system</p>
<p>4/25/25, 11:30AM - Craig Mulder: Good idea Ninotte!</p>
<p>4/25/25, 11:30AM - Kate Mazzara: Perfect thanks.  I thought that was the case...</p>
<p>Absolutely we should </p>
<p>Will the come out of supply budget</p>
<p>4/25/25, 11:34AM - Craig Mulder: Go ahead and purchase Ninotte.  The expense will be listed as a supply rather than equipment since the cost is under $1000. But I don't see it being part of the maternal supplies budget that we have set up.</p>
<p>4/25/25, 11:46AM - Kate Mazzara: So, it's not the quarterly supply budget that is $1,000 for midwifery/office supplies? Correct</p>
